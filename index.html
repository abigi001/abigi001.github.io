        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science/International AffairsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have been involved in leadership and guidance positions for the past three years of my academic yearsâ€“ I began teaching English courses in my senior year of high school to students whose English was not their first language. I would make sure the students were practicing their language skills, following instructions and doing better on language placement examinations. The following summer, I volunteered to be a peer supervisor at the camp run by the Armenian Youth Federation (AYF). I managed to keep a steady routine there by keeping a full schedule and working on my own research thesis on mental disorders. I would go to my team's cabin as an AYF peer supervisor every morning to make sure everyone was comfortable and that any needs or concerns were being taken care of. I encouraged everyone to communicate to one another and engage in conversation in order to maintain the camp's friendly atmosphere. I would meet with my cabin and others, during the week and lead entertaining and instructive activities. For instance, we collected and practiced our traditional songs and dances while simultaneously exploring the importance of the intellectual arts that were taught to us. Additionally, in my first academic year at UCR, I was able to intern at our Immigration Legal Services through the internship offered by Undocumented Student Program, the Butterfly Project. I was able to support undocumented students with the help of my mentor Alfonso by writing professional letters for them that stated the representation of their case to United States Immigration and Citizenship Services. As my second academic year began I was motivated to start my own organizations on campus and further support underrepresented communities such as Queer South West-Asian and North African students at UCR. I was able to lead and table at the Stonewall event in Winter Quarter 2024 and meet passionate first year students. This allowed me to gain practical and transferable;professional skills that could be used as a future Residential Advisor. <br><br>

         I have attended protests, workshops, meetings, and even conferences such as the SWANA Conference. That motivated me to create two organizations Queer SWANA, and Student for Justice in Artsakh like last fall quarter. Both dedicated to serve underrepresented communities at UCR. Today, I am proud to express that I am the voice for Queer Armenians undocumented students; and any underrepresented individual. I also serve as the Statewide Relations Director Assistant at Associated Students of UCR. My journey began as an Armenian Student Associationâ€™s member when I watched my people die while the media and western governments turned a blind eye to the ethnic cleansing that took place in Artsakh last September.<br><br>

         I contacted the VP of External Affairs and Government Relations Director for immediate support and acknowledgement by the UC Riverside campus and each other UC. They responded with the opportunity of hosting a presentation to the UCSA meeting on October 7th which I was able to prepare for. Meanwhile I did not have a professional experience of leading such a workshop to the board of UC Student Association, I was afraid it would not go well. Although, through the time I spent on it, additionally the feedback support I received from VP of External and GR Director was so helpful. I was able to pass a resolution as a student and a member of ASA at UC Riverside for the first time yearsâ€“they had expressed that it was uncommon for a student to pass a resolution. That led me to committing to the ASUCR team, and becoming the Statewide Relations Director Assistant, allowing me to continue helping underrepresented communities.
